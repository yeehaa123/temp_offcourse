Our guess would be 'too\nmany'. Somehow, we keep creating new textbooks and courses, but most\ninformation is out there already. You just need a set up that organizes\nthis knowledge in one place, with just the right amount of structure. You\ndon’t want to be told what to learn, but you don’t want to figure it out\nfrom scratch either. So gather those interesting blog posts, podcasts, or\ntutorials, add your comments, and share them. That’s it!\n","checkpoints":[{"title":"Structure Your Story","introduction":"Learning and curation at Offcourse are built around waypoints. Think of\nthem as narratives. Like every good story, they need a structure: a\nbeginning, an end, and exciting events. At Offcourse events are called\ncheckpoints.

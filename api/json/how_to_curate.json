Our guess would be 'too\nmany'. Somehow, we keep creating new textbooks and courses, but most\ninformation is out there already. You just need a set up that organizes the\nthis knowledge in one place, with just the right amount of structure. You\ndon’t want to be told what to learn, but you don’t want to figure it out\nfrom scratch either. So gather those interesting blog posts, podcasts, or\ntutorials, add your comments, and share them. That’s it!\n","checkpoints":[{"title":"Structure your Story","description":"Learning and curation on unacademic is built around waypoints. Think of\nthem as narratives. And like every good story, they need a structure: a\nbeginning, an end, and several other exciting events in between them.\n\nEvents in unacademic are called checkpoints. As a curator, you use them\nto contextualize the resources that you want to share with others.Learners\nuse checkpoints to track their progress within your story.\n\nPeople tend to be more motivated in their learning when its a story,\nso create and curate your waypoints accordingly.\n","instructions":["Read the reference for inspiration"],"resources":[{"author":"Chuck Wendig","title":"25 Ways to

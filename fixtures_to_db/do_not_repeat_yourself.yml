  How many wheels have you had to reinvent already? Our guess would be 'too
  many'. Somehow, we keep creating new textbooks and courses, but most
  information is out there already. You just need a set up that organizes
  this knowledge in one place, with just the right amount of structure. You
  don’t want to be told what to learn, but you don’t want to figure it out
  from scratch either. So gather those interesting blog posts, podcasts, or
  tutorials, add your comments, and share them. That’s it!

    description: |
      Learning and curation at Offcourse are built around waypoints. Think of
      them as narratives. Like every good story, they need a structure: a
      beginning, an end, and exciting events. At Offcourse events are called
      checkpoints. You use them to contextualize the resources you want to share.
      Learners use checkpoints to track their progress within your story.
